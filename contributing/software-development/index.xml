      <description>We assume you to have basic coding knowledge. If you don&amp;rsquo;t, we recommend that you read the chapters Introduction, Beginning C and Intermediate C of the C Wikibookand make some exercises (or something equivalent).
The MATE Desktop is mostly written in C. Some projects are written in Python or C++.
You should already have a text editor like Pluma, Gedit or Kate and a terminal application like MATE Terminalinstalled. Alternatively you could use a fully featured IDE such as VSCodium, Eclipseor Code::Blocks.</description>

      <description>To run the newest version of a MATE project, often it is not enough to build it from source (i.e. it can not be executed with ./my-program). To work properly it need to be installed, because the installation process ensures that all the needed files are copied to the right places.
   Building Installing Uninstall      Building     First make sure you have all dependencies of the package installed:</description>

      <description>Although written in C, most MATE applications are heavily based on Object Oriented Programming principles.
Since the C Programming-Language was not created with Object Oriented Programming in mind, it has no explicit support for classes, inheritance, polymorphism and other OO Concepts. Neither does it have its own Virtual Table, which is found in object-oriented languages such C++, Java and C#. Therefore, it might not be as easy to implement an object-oriented programming paradigm using only C&amp;rsquo;s language features and standard library.</description>
